## Submission Guidelines

To streamline the submission process, we rely on the **ACL submission guidelines** and the **START conference system**, accessible at [https://softconf.com/acl2026/bea2026/](https://softconf.com/acl2026/bea2026/).
All submissions undergo review by the [program committee](/bea/2026/#program-committee).

### Long, Short, and Demo Papers

Authors can choose to submit long papers (up to eight (8) pages) or short papers (up to four (4) pages), alongside unlimited references.
After peer review, all accepted papers will be allotted an additional page of content (up to nine for long papers, five for short papers), allowing authors to address reviewer comments.
Authors are strongly urged to present a live demonstration for papers that elaborate on systems.
If opting for this, authors should choose either "long paper + demo" or "short paper + demo" under the "Submission Category" on the submission page.

### LaTeX and Word Templates

Authors must ensure their paper submissions adhere to the general paper formatting guidelines for "*ACL" conferences, found [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html), and use the **official ACL style templates**, downloadable [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).
Do not modify these style files or use templates intended for other conferences.
Submissions failing to meet required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

### Limitations

Authors are required to discuss the limitations of their work in a dedicated section titled "Limitations".
This section should be included at the end of the paper, before the references, and it will not count toward the page limit.
This includes both, long and short papers.
Note, prior to the December 2023 cycle, this was optional.

### Ethics Policy

Authors are required to honour the ethical code set out in the [ACL Code of Ethics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics).
The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent.
We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code.
Authors are encouraged to devote a section of their paper to concerns about the ethical impact of the work and to a discussion of broader impacts of the work, which will be taken into account in the review process.
This discussion may extend into a 5th page (short papers) or 9th page (long papers).

### Anonymity

In accordance with ACL policy, pre-prints are allowed. However, given the blind review process, it is still essential to ensure that papers themselves remain anonymous.
Authors should avoid self-references that disclose their identity (e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991)”), opting instead for citations like “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)”.

### Conflicts of Interest

Authors are required to mark potential reviewers who have co-authored the paper, belong to the same research group or institution, or have had prior exposure to the paper, ensuring transparency in the review process.

### Double Submissions

We adhere to the official ACL double-submission policy.
If papers are submitted to both BEA and another conference or workshop, authors must specify the other event on the title page (as a footnote on the abstract).
Additionally, the title page should state that if the paper is accepted for presentation at BEA, it will be withdrawn from other conferences and workshops.

### Republications

Previously published papers will not be accepted.
