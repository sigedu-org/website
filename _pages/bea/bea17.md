## Workshop Description

The BEA Workshop is a leading venue for NLP innovation in the context of educational applications. It is one of the largest one-day workshops in the ACL community with over 100 registered attendees in the past several years. The growing interest in educational applications and a diverse community of researchers involved resulted in the creation of the [Special Interest Group in Educational Applications (SIGEDU)](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=2019Q3_Reports:_SIGEDU) in 2017, which currently has 240 members.
 
The workshop’s continuing growth highlights the alignment between societal needs and technological advances: for instance, BEA16 in 2021 hosted a panel discussion on New Challenges for Educational Technology in the Time of the Pandemic addressing the pressing issues around COVID19. NLP capabilities can now support an array of learning domains, including writing, speaking, reading, science, and mathematics, as well as the related intra-personal (e.g., self-confidence) and inter-personal (e.g., peer collaboration) skills. Within these areas, the community continues to develop and deploy innovative NLP approaches for use in educational settings. Another breakthrough for educational applications within the CL community is the presence of a number of shared-task competitions organized by the BEA workshop over the past several years, including four shared tasks on grammatical error detection and correction alone. NLP/Education shared tasks have also seen new areas of research, such as the Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing at BEA11, Native Language Identification at BEA12, Second Language Acquisition Modelling at BEA13, and Complex Word Identification at BEA13. These competitions increased the visibility of, and interest in, our field.
 
The 17th BEA workshop will have keynotes by Klinton Bicknell (Duolingo) and Alexandra Cristea (University of Durham), an invited paper presentation by a member of one of the educational societies from the International Alliance to Advance Learning in the Digital Era (IAALDE), oral presentation sessions, a large poster session to maximize the amount of original work presented, and a panel discussion to encourage interaction between workshop participants. We expect that the workshop will continue to highlight novel technologies and opportunities for educational NLP in English as well as other languages. The workshop will solicit both full papers and short papers for either oral or poster presentation.
 
We will solicit papers that incorporate NLP methods, including, but not limited to:
 
- automated scoring of open-ended textual and spoken responses;
- automated scoring/evaluation for written student responses (across multiple genres);
- game-based instruction and assessment;
- educational data mining;
- intelligent tutoring;
- collaborative learning environments;
- peer review;
- grammatical error detection and correction;
- learner cognition;
- spoken dialog;
- multimodal applications;
- annotation standards and schemas;
- tools and applications for classroom teachers, learners and/or test developers; and
- use of corpora in educational tools.

## Workshop Program

### Invited Talks

The workshop will have **two keynote presentations** and **one ambassador paper presentation** from the 2021 Annual Meeting of the [ISLS](https://www.isls.org) (International Society of the Learning Sciences), a member society of the [IAALDE](https://alliancelss.com) (International Alliance to Advance Learning in the Digital Era).

<i>ML and NLP for Language Learning at Scale</i>

**Abstract:** As scalable learning technologies become ubiquitous, it generates a large amount of student data, which can be used with machine learning and NLP to develop new instructional technologies, such as personalized practice schedules and adaptive lessons. Additionally, machine learning and NLP are uniquely poised to solve the problems inherent in scaling language instruction to a large number of languages and courses. In this talk, I will describe several projects illustrating these two uses of ML and NLP in language learning at scale at Duolingo – the world’s largest language education platform with over 100 courses and around 40 million monthly active learners.

**Alexandra Cristea**, Durham University <br>
<i>Aspects of Learning Analytics</i>

**Abstract:** My favourite definition of Learning Analytics (LA) is Eric Duval’s: LA means 
”collecting traces that learners leave behind and using those traces to improve 
learning.”, and I’ll tell you more about why during my talk.  Whilst the term LA 
was coined relatively recently (2011), it is a growing area of interest, with 
immediate practical application, albeit a growing research area at the same 
time, bringing together many classic as well as cutting edge methodologies, such
as statistics, data mining, machine learning (including deep learning), network 
analysis and visualisation. This talk will bring together an understanding of LA as 
an emerging discipline and research area, as well as new research directions in 
LA, such as applications in gamification, explainable AI, predicting certification of
students, urgent instructor intervenion (where we do use a bit of NLP), and 
further predict the development and maturity of this area as a whole.

<i>Taking Transactivity to the Next Level</i>

**Abstract:** Transactivity is a valued collaborative process, which has been associated with elevated learning gains, collaborative product quality, and knowledge transfer within teams. Dynamic forms of collaboration support have made use of real time monitoring of transactivity, and automation of its analysis has been affirmed as valuable to the field. Early models were able to achieve high reliability within restricted domains. More recent approaches have achieved a level of generality across learning domains. In this study, we investigate generalizability of models developed primarily in computer science courses to a new student population, namely, masters students in a leadership course, where we observe strikingly different patterns of transactive exchange than in prior studies. This difference prompted both a reformulation of the coding standards and innovation in the modeling approach, both of which we report on here.

## Registration

If you wish to attend the workshop, you must register with the NAACL conference and select BEA from the list of offered workshops. More information can be found [here](https://2022.naacl.org/registration/). There is no need to have a paper accepted. The workshop is open to anyone who wishes to attend. **Importantly, at least one author of each accepted paper must register.**

## Submission Information

We will be using the NAACL Submission Guidelines for the BEA Workshop this year. Authors are invited to submit a long paper of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. We also invite short papers of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers’ comments in their final versions. Papers which describe systems are also invited to give a demo of their system. If you would like to present a demo in addition to presenting the paper, please make sure to select either “long paper + demo” or “short paper + demo” under “Submission Category” in the START submission page.

Previously published papers cannot be accepted. The submissions will be reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. Self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”.

We have also included conflict of interest in the submission form. You should mark all potential reviewers who have been authors on the paper, are from the same research group or institution, or who have seen versions of this paper or discussed it with you.

We will be using the START conference system to manage submissions: [https://www.softconf.com/naacl2022/BEA2022/](https://www.softconf.com/naacl2022/BEA2022/)

### LaTeX and Word Templates

Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available from [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files). Please follow the paper formatting guidelines general to "*ACL" conferences available [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html). Authors may not modify these style files or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

### Double Submission Policy

We will follow the official ACL double-submission policy. Specifically:
Papers being submitted both to BEA and another conference or workshop must:
- Note on the title page the other conference or workshop to which they are being submitted.
- State on the title page that if the authors choose to present their paper at BEA (assuming it was accepted), then the paper will be withdrawn from other conferences and workshops.

## Sponsors

We are extremely grateful to our sponsors for the past workshops: in the recent years, we have been supported by [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com/), [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/), [NBME](https://nbme.org/), [iLexIR](https://ilexir.co.uk/), [Educational Testing Service](https://www.ets.org/), and [Newsela](https://newsela.com/). This year, we want to continue helping students to attend the workshop, including the accommodation of the student post-workshop dinner (in case the workshop runs offline) and offering student grants covering the BEA registration fees. We are hoping to identify sponsors who might be willing to contribute $100 (Bronze), $250 (Silver) or $500 (Gold sponsorship) to subsidize some of the workshop costs. Perks of sponsorship include logos on the workshop website and in the proceedings. If you would like to sponsor the BEA, please send us an [email](mailto:bea.nlp.workshop@gmail.com).
