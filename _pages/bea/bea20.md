## Workshop Description

The **BEA Workshop** is a leading venue for NLP innovation in the context of educational applications.
It is one of the largest one-day workshops in the ACL community with over 100 registered attendees in the past several years.
The growing interest in educational applications and a diverse community of researchers involved resulted in the creation of the [Special Interest Group in Educational Applications (SIGEDU)](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=2019Q3_Reports:_SIGEDU) in 2017, which currently has over 400 members.

The **workshop's continuing growth** reflects how technology is increasingly fulfilling societal demands.
For instance, the BEA16 workshop in 2021 hosted a panel discussion on "New Challenges for Educational Technology in the Time of the Pandemic" addressing the pressing issues around COVID-19.
Additionally, NLP has evolved to aid diverse learning domains, including writing, speaking, reading, science, and mathematics, as well as the related intra-personal (e.g., self-confidence) and inter-personal (e.g., peer collaboration) skills.
Within these areas, the community continues to develop and deploy innovative NLP approaches for use in educational settings.

Another significant advancement in educational applications within the Computational Linguistics (CL) community is the **continuing series of shared-task competitions** organized by and hosted at the BEA workshop.
Over the years, this initiative has included four dedicated tasks focused solely on grammatical error detection and correction.
Moreover, NLP/Education shared tasks have expanded into novel research areas, such as the [Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing](/sharedtask/2016) at BEA11, [Native Language Identification](/sharedtask/2017) at BEA12, [Second Language Acquisition Modeling](/sharedtask/2018-SLAM) at BEA13, [Complex Word Identification](/sharedtask/2018-CWI) at BEA13, [Generating AI Teacher Responses in Educational Dialogues](/sharedtask/2023) at BEA18, and [Automated Prediction of Item Difficulty and Item Response Time](https://sig-edu.org/sharedtask/2024) and [Multilingual Lexical Simplification](https://sites.google.com/view/mlsp-sharedtask-2024) at BEA19.
These competitions have significantly bolstered the visibility and interest in our field.

**The 20th BEA will be the first edition of BEA as a 2-day workshop**. It will adopt the same format as the 2024 edition and will be **hybrid**, integrating both in-person and virtual presentations and attendance.
The workshop will feature a **keynote talk**, and a main workshop track with **oral presentation sessions** and **large poster sessions** to facilitate the presentation of a wide array of original research.
Moreover, there will be **a half-day tutorial**, and **a shared task** comprising an oral *overview presentation* by the shared task organizers and several *poster presentations* by the shared task participants.

We expect that the workshop will continue to **highlight novel technologies and opportunities**, including the use of state-of-the-art large language models in educational applications, and challenges around responsible AI for educational NLP, in English as well as other languages.

### Submission Guidelines

To streamline the submission process, we rely on the **ACL submission guidelines** and the **START conference system**, accessible at [https://softconf.com/acl2025/bea2025/](https://softconf.com/acl2025/bea2025/).
All submissions undergo review by the [program committee](#program-committee).

Long, Short, and Demo Papers
: Authors can choose to submit long papers (up to eight (8) pages) or short papers (up to four (4) pages), alongside unlimited references.
After peer review, all accepted papers will be allotted an additional page of content (up to nine for long papers, five for short papers), allowing authors to address reviewer comments.
Authors are strongly urged to present a live demonstration for papers that elaborate on systems.
If opting for this, authors should choose either "long paper + demo" or "short paper + demo" under the "Submission Category" on the submission page.

LaTeX and Word Templates
: Authors must ensure their paper submissions adhere to the general paper formatting guidelines for "*ACL" conferences, found [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html), and use the **official ACL style templates**, downloadable [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).
Do not modify these style files or use templates intended for other conferences.
Submissions failing to meet required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

Limitations
: Authors are required to discuss the limitations of their work in a dedicated section titled "Limitations".
This section should be included at the end of the paper, before the references, and it will not count toward the page limit.
This includes both long and short papers.
Note, prior to the December 2023 cycle, this was optional.

Ethics Policy
: Authors are required to honour the ethical code set out in the [ACL Code of Ethics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics).
The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent.
We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code.
Authors are encouraged to devote a section of their paper to concerns about the ethical impact of the work and to a discussion of broader impacts of the work, which will be taken into account in the review process.
This discussion may extend into a 5th page (short papers) or 9th page (long papers).

Anonymity
: Given the blind review process, it is essential to ensure that papers remain anonymous.
Authors should avoid self-references that disclose their identity (e.g., ‚ÄúWe previously showed (Smith, 1991)‚Äù), opting instead for citations like ‚ÄúSmith previously showed (Smith, 1991)‚Äù.

Conflicts of Interest
: Authors are required to mark potential reviewers who have co-authored the paper, belong to the same research group or institution, or have had prior exposure to the paper, ensuring transparency in the review process.

Double Submissions
: We adhere to the official ACL double-submission policy.
If papers are submitted to both BEA and another conference or workshop, authors must specify the other event on the title page (as a footnote on the abstract).
Additionally, the title page should state that if the paper is accepted for presentation at BEA, it will be withdrawn from other conferences and workshops.

Republications
: Previously published papers will not be accepted.

### Presentation Guidelines

All accepted papers must be presented at the workshop to appear in the proceedings.
The workshop will include both in-person and virtual presentation options.
**At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early registration deadline.**

Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the workshop organizers.
While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.

###  Share Code & Data on GitHub

If you are interested in sharing your code and data with the BEA community, we created the [#bea-workshop](https://github.com/topics/bea-workshop) topic on GitHub.

## Shared Task

In addition to the main track, the workshop will host a shared task on **Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors**. For more information on how to participate and latest updates, please refer to the shared task website.

### [Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors](/sharedtask/2025)

## Tutorial

We will also host a half-day tutorial on **LLMs for Education: Understanding the Needs of Stakeholders, Current Capabilities and the Path Forward**.

### LLMs for Education: Understanding the Needs of Stakeholders, Current Capabilities and the Path Forward

*Organizers*: Sankalan Pal Chowdhury (ETH Zurich), Nico Daheim (TU Darmstadt), Ekaterina Kochmar (MBZUAI), Jakub Macina (ETH Zurich), Donya Rooein (Bocconi University), Mrinmaya Sachan (ETH Zurich), and Shashank Sonkar (Rice University).
