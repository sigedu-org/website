## Description

The **BEA Workshop** is a leading venue for NLP innovation in the context of educational applications.
It is one of the largest one-day workshops in the ACL community with over 100 registered attendees in the past several years.
The growing interest in educational applications and a diverse community of researchers involved resulted in the creation of the [Special Interest Group in Educational Applications (SIGEDU)](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=2019Q3_Reports:_SIGEDU) in 2017, which currently has over 400 members.

The **workshop's continuing growth** reflects how technology is increasingly fulfilling societal demands.
For instance, the BEA16 workshop in 2021 hosted a panel discussion on "New Challenges for Educational Technology in the Time of the Pandemic" addressing the pressing issues around COVID-19.
Additionally, NLP has evolved to aid diverse learning domains, including writing, speaking, reading, science, and mathematics, as well as the related intra-personal (e.g., self-confidence) and inter-personal (e.g., peer collaboration) skills.
Within these areas, the community continues to develop and deploy innovative NLP approaches for use in educational settings.

Another significant advancement in educational applications within the Computational Linguistics (CL) community is the **continuing series of shared-task competitions** organized by and hosted at the BEA workshop.
Over the years, this initiative has included four dedicated tasks focused solely on grammatical error detection and correction.
Moreover, NLP/Education shared tasks have expanded into novel research areas, such as the [Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing](/sharedtask/2016) at BEA11, [Native Language Identification](/sharedtask/2017) at BEA12, [Second Language Acquisition Modeling](/sharedtask/2018-SLAM) at BEA13, [Complex Word Identification](/sharedtask/2018-CWI) at BEA13, [Generating AI Teacher Responses in Educational Dialogues](/sharedtask/2023) at BEA18, and [Automated Prediction of Item Difficulty and Item Response Time](https://sig-edu.org/sharedtask/2024) and [Multilingual Lexical Simplification](https://sites.google.com/view/mlsp-sharedtask-2024) at BEA19.
These competitions have significantly bolstered the visibility and interest in our field.

**The 20th BEA will be the first edition of BEA as a 2-day workshop**. It will adopt the same format as the 2024 edition and will be **hybrid**, integrating both in-person and virtual presentations and attendance.
The workshop will feature a **keynote talk**, and a main workshop track with **oral presentation sessions** and **large poster sessions** to facilitate the presentation of a wide array of original research.
Moreover, there will be **a half-day tutorial**, and **a shared task** comprising an oral *overview presentation* by the shared task organizers and several *poster presentations* by the shared task participants.

We expect that the workshop will continue to **highlight novel technologies and opportunities**, including the use of state-of-the-art large language models in educational applications, and challenges around responsible AI for educational NLP, in English as well as other languages.

## Shared Task

In addition to the main track, the workshop will host a shared task:

### Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors

For more information on how to participate and latest updates, please refer to the [shared task website](/sharedtask/2025).

## Tutorial

In addition to the main track, the workshop will host a half-day tutorial:

### LLMs for Education: Understanding the Needs of Stakeholders, Current Capabilities and the Path Forward

**Organizers:** Sankalan Pal Chowdhury (ETH Zurich), Nico Daheim (TU Darmstadt), Ekaterina Kochmar (MBZUAI), Jakub Macina (ETH Zurich), Donya Rooein (Bocconi University), Mrinmaya Sachan (ETH Zurich), and Shashank Sonkar (Rice University).
{: .notice}

**Description:** This tutorial will aim to bridge the gap between NLP researchers and Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) practitioners to help participants understand the requirements and challenges of education, enabling them to develop LLMs that align with educational needs, and to enable educators to gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current NLP technologies, fostering effective integration of LLMs in educational contexts.

## Invited Talk

### ![Keynote](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20-KEYNOTE-orange?style=flat-square)<a name="#kostiantyn-omelianchuk" style="visibility: hidden;">Kostiantyn Omelianchuk (Grammarly)</a> 

**Kostiantyn Omelianchuk**, Grammarly<br>
<i>How LLMs Are Reshaping GEC: Training, Evaluation, and Task Framing</i>

**Abstract:** This keynote will explore the evolving role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in training and evaluating Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems, using Grammarly as a case study. It will cover the shift from primarily using human-annotated corpora to semi-synthetic data generation approaches, examining its impact on model training, evaluation practices, and overall task definition. Key topics include task definition challenges, trade-offs between data types, observed biases in models, and recent advances in LLM-based evaluation techniques. The talk will also explore scalable approaches for multilingual GEC and outline implications for future research.

**Bio:** Kostiantyn Omelianchuk is an Applied Research Scientist and Area Tech Lead at Grammarly, where he works on practical applications of NLP, with a primary interest in Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). He has over nine years of experience in the field and has co-authored several papers, including _GECToR: Grammatical Error Correction ‚Äì Tag, Not Rewrite_, a widely used approach in the GEC community. His research explores edit-based modeling, the use of large language models for text correction and simplification, and the transition from human-annotated to synthetic data for training and evaluation. His recent work focuses on multilingual GEC, LLM-based evaluation methods, and synthetic data generation.
