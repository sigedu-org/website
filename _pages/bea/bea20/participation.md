### For Authors and Presenters

In accordance with ACL policy, at least one author of each accepted paper must register by the early registration deadline. 

- If you are presenting the paper, you are required to select the “Registering Paper” category.
- Co-authors who are attending but not presenting do not need to select this category; one registration per paper is sufficient.
- Presenters of shared task papers are exempt from selecting the “Registering Paper” category.

## Volunteering

The BEA workshop does not offer any volunteer opportunities. However, the ACL conference provides student volunteering opportunities for eligible applicants. Successful candidates receive a registration fee waiver. Details and application instructions are available [here](https://2025.aclweb.org/calls/volunteers/). The application deadline is **June 6th, 2025**.
