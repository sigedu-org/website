The [BEA 2026](/bea/2026) Workshop (co-located with ACL in San Diego, California, United States, on July 2nd or 3rd, 2026) invites applications and nominations for panelists to participate in a **panel discussion on "Transitioning from Academia to the EdTech Industry."** This panel aims to share practical insights, career pathways, challenges, and lessons learned by individuals who have navigated (or actively support) the move from academic careers into industry roles within educational technology.

The panel will be of interest to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty, and academic staff considering or preparing for careers in EdTech startups, established companies, or industry research labs.

# Panel Focus
Panelists are expected to address topics such as:
- Motivation for transitioning from academia to EdTech
- Differences in culture, expectations, and impact between academia and industry
- Translating academic skills (research, teaching, publishing) to industry roles
- Career paths in EdTech (e.g., product, research, UX, data science, learning design)
- Advice for early-career researchers and faculty considering the transition

# Eligibility & Selection Criteria
Panelists will be selected based on the following criteria:
- Relevant Experience: Demonstrated experience transitioning from academia to the EdTech industry, or substantial experience hiring, mentoring, or collaborating with academics in EdTech roles.
- Diversity of Perspectives: We aim to assemble a panel with diverse backgrounds, career stages, roles (e.g., startup, large company, research-focused, product-focused), and identities.
- Ability to Communicate Insights Clearly: Willingness and ability to share candid, reflective, and actionable advice with an academic audience.
- Engagement with the BEA Community: Experience or interest in BEA-related research areas, education, NLP, or applied AI for learning is a plus.
- In-Person Attendance: Panelists must be able to attend the BEA 2026 workshop in person at the conference venue and actively participate in the live panel discussion and Q&A.

Interested individuals may apply directly or be nominated by others. Submissions should include:
- Name, affiliation, and current role
- A brief bio (150–200 words) highlighting relevant experience
- A short statement (100–150 words) describing what perspective you would bring to the panel
- Confirmation of ability to attend the workshop in person
