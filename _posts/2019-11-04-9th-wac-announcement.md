Dear SIGEDU Community,

The **9th International Conference on Writing Analytics: Expanding the Body of Knowledge** is a wonderful opportunity to learn more about the interplay between technology, writing and education. We invite you to submit proposals to the conference. Submitted proposals must relate to the conference theme: expanding the body of knowledge in writing analytics. Proposals should be between 500&ndash;2000 words. Proposals must be submitted by November 15th to both [Susan Lang](mailto:lang.543@osu.edu) and [Norbert Elliot](mailto:nelliot3@usf.edu).

The conference takes place from February 6&ndash;8, 2020 and is sponsored by the University of South Florida at St. Petersburg. For more details, please visit the conference [website](https://writinganalytics.colostate.edu/).
