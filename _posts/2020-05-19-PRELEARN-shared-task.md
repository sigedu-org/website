Dear SIGEDU Community,

We are excited to invite participants to PRELEARN, the first shared task on Automatic Prerequisite Relation Learning.

E-learning platforms and electronic educational materials proved themselves as valuable resources at all educational levels and their massive use has shed light on the need of developing intelligent agents able to support both students and teachers by, e.g., automatically identifying educational relations between learning concepts. 

The PRELEARN shared task tackles this problem asking participants to submit their models for automatic prerequisite learning. Prerequisite relations are the most relevant among all educational relations since they establish which sequence of concepts allows students to have a full understanding of a subject. 
The systems will be challenged to identify prerequisite concept pairs on different domains and training scenarios.

The goal of this shared task is not only to address open issues of automatic prerequisite learning, but also to gather for the first time the community of researchers and industry professionals interested in the topic.  

Training data are available on the [task website](https://sites.google.com/view/prelearn20/data) and the evaluation windows will be open between 4th and 24th September 2020. Systems will be presented in Bologna, Italy (30th November - 3rd December 2020) during EVALITA 2020 conference (co-located with CLiC-it 2020).

Thanks,

*The PRELEARN organizing committee*
